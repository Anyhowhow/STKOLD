These custom icon markers include Military Ground Order Battle designators, unix STK/VO 3D models
converted to bitmap images, and the standard STK/PC custom icon markers. To use this extensive list 
of custom icons, rename the MarkersWin directory (located under C:/Agi/Stk/3.0/STKData/Pixmaps) 
to MarkersWin_original. Create a new folder called MarkersWin and copy the contents of 
MarkersWin.mil to MarkersWin. The custom icons will now appear as an option in the icon list under 
Properties/Graphics for each object (e.g.Facility, Vehicle, etc.).
